# fashion_shop
Landing page. The aim of the project is to extend skills in SASS used with Gulp. jQuery adds some functionalities to the sites of the project. Namely, I add star rating system for a product on product1.html and product4.html sits, as well as animation of the content of the company's history and its values that can be showed and hidden on the about.html site. One can enjoy similar effects on the fashion.html site where both important fashion terms and short description of fashion magazines can be expanded and hidden. There are links to the internet sites of the magazines too included in the description. Page under construction is a placeholder for the future progress in this sphere (still, it's a fake fashion shop site). One can simulate enrolling for a fashion newsletter where both error and success is marked with a SweetAlert2 pop-up alert. There is also a contact site with a map (linked with Google maps) and simple contact form. Finally, I added FAQ site with (fake)questions and answers as a jQuery accordion.
